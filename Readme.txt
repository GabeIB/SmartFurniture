Hack Generation Y hack by Smart Furniture

This hack allows the user to control any IR controlled device using a Leap-Motion.
This includes computers, TVs, and some Android phones.

We believe that this could one day be integrated into Smart Furniture.
No more digging through the couch cushions to find that lost remote.

Note: the Leap-Motion is not plugged into the Mac that it's controlling.
What's happening is the leap is communicating with a raspberry pi which sends programmed signals to the Mac.
This also works with televisions with no change to the code.

This is technology at your fingertips.
